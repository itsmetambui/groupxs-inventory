- This project is host at: [groupxs.netlify.com](groupxs.netlify.com)
- Below is the main points that'll help reviewers to better go through the project üëç.

### It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses:

[Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) because it's 2020  
[React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) to handle client side routing  
[Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) to handle State Management
[Redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) to reduce Redux boilerplate
[Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) for its very complete set of components  
[Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) to extend Ant's default component styling  
[TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss) to elegantly handle the rest of your app's UI  
[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) as a proper Http client  
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) because it's just too helpful
